Technologist looking to build slick, large-scale & beautiful web applications. A programmer at heart and an engineer by mind. When I'm not coding (in React or [some bleeding-edge front-end micro-framework](https://hyperapp.js.org/)), I'm probably cooking, travelling or professing my undying love to Docker & Portainer.

I love building teams that deliver great, pixel-perfect, usable products. I care deeply about the people I work with. I bring a *never say die* attitude to any team, and ensure that everyone is pushing code of the highest quality. I love writing tests & teach as much as I can learn.

##### BAE Systems Applied Intelligence
**Lead Front-end Developer** | _June 2015 - December 2017_ | _Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia_

Engineered a webapp built on Angular, ES7, SCSS, Angular Material that runs of 30 different browser / device combinations from Retina displays to mobile browsers, weeks ahead of schedule.

  - Led a team of ten developers to deliver, ahead of schedule a web application & mobile app which strict acceptance criteria for performance in low bandwidth areas.
  - Ensured product quality by enforcing unit and integration tests.
  - Conceived and implemented a filtering system that can be used in any project as a drop-in component (that can search and in-browser list of anything or pass it off to the backend).
  - Engaged closely with UX daily to unsure delivery of a usable and slick-looking product. Adviced against bad user experience and convulated user journeys.
  - Evaluated requirements with Business Analysts to ensure stories are short, well-worded and most importantly, closable, with clear acceptance criteria.
  - Ensured code was functional and lean with performance and usability as the pillars.
  - Planned sprints and delegated tasks across the front-end team.
  - Developed a reusable library / UX components within the first couple of sprints so that there was minimal to no front-end effort needed at the later stages of the project. Focused on building highly configurable components rather than thousands of lines of redundant code.
  - Involved heavily in code-reviews and (declining) pull-requests that would take the easy way out, have bad tests, or lack code comments.
  - Promoted code reusability above all else, and ensured that we had a 90% higher test coverage when our deliverable limit was 80%.
  - Streamlined and enhanced team's output by using an assembly-line mindset when managing task deligation. The payoff was huge as we continually impressed every sprint by delivering impressive work, consistenly. This however, will only work with a good, multi-disciplined team.
  - Involved heavily with DevOps and build automation as I feel right at home on the command line.

  - Delivered dashboards consisting of heatmaps, filters, timelines and drill-down hunting using Highcharts / Highmaps / Angular / SASS that would interface with an elastic search backend.
  - Accelerated development of a pixel-perfect product with a strict delivery timeline, whilst keeping a focus on best practices.
  - Undertook interviewing and hiring of an extremely capable (and super-awesome) front-end development  team, which I eventually led - that could deliver complex and interesting projects.
  - Formulated a guide of best-practices in building good software for the front-end developers.
