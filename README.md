> Excuse me, but, there's a container for that :)

A battle-hardened technologist interested in building beautiful, large-scale and user-friendly web and mobile applications.

♥ functional programming, coding UI, i3, the command line & Vim.

A programmer at heart and an engineer by mind. When I'm not coding (in React, React-Native or some bleeding-edge front-end micro-framework), I'm probably cooking, travelling or professing my undying love to micro-containers.

I love building teams that deliver great, pixel-perfect, usable products, and I love getting my hands dirty with code when duty calls. I care deeply about the people I work with. I bring a *never say die* attitude to any team and ensure that everyone is pushing code of the highest quality. I love writing tests & teach as much as I can learn.

##### BAE Systems Applied Intelligence
**Lead Front-end Developer** | _June 2015 - December 2017_ | _Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia_

Engineered a web app built on Angular, ES7/8, SCSS, Angular Material that runs of 30 different browser/device combinations from Retina displays to mobile browsers, weeks ahead of schedule.

  - Led a team of ten developers to deliver, ahead of schedule a web application & mobile app which strict acceptance criteria for performance in low bandwidth areas.
  - Engaged with UX daily to ensure delivery of a usable and slick-looking product, advising against bad user experience and convoluted user journeys.
  - Evaluated requirements with Business Analysts to ensure stories are short, well-worded with clear acceptance criteria and most importantly, closable.
  - Spearheaded a culture of writing good code with performance and usability as pillars.
  - Planned sprints and delegated tasks across the front-end team, and delivering features 4-5 sprints ahead of schedule.
  - Developed a reusable library of UX components within the first couple of sprints so that there was minimal to no front-end effort at the later stages of the project. Guided the team to build highly configurable and reusable components.
  - Involved heavily in code-reviews and (declining) pull-requests that would take the easy way out, have bad tests, or lack code comments and had a 90% test coverage when our deliverable limit was 80%.
  - Streamlined team output by using an assembly-line mindset when managing task delegation. The payoff: we closed every sprint by delivering impressive work, consistently, keeping morale and confidence high.
  - Involved heavily with DevOps and build automation as I feel right at home on the command line.

#### FAQ (for geeky souls)
  - [ ] **What technologies are being used to build this resume?**
    Absolutely no Javascript is used in the browser. The resume is based on one markdown file and spell-checked and built using markdown by my trusty TravisCI. I use Neovim for coding, and (mostly) node to build.
  - [ ] **Why are you using CSS variables in SCSS? Are you mad?**
    CSS variables can be inherited and scoped. This allows me to achieve things like changing the background and all other elements on the page with _zero_ javascript based on the `:checked` pseudo selector (still finding the perfect solution). I feel that I'm going to just use CSS variables for now rather than SCSS from now on - why? Because I'm debugging variable changes in the browser where it belongs.
  - [ ] **Are you available for work?**
    Yes.
  - [ ] **The README.md file seems to be in a different order. Is this intentional?**
    Yes, I used flex-ordering and sibling selectors (~) to re-order sections.
  - [ ] **That seems like overkill. Why couldn't you just wrap each section in a `<section class="interests">` tag and style them that way?**
    I think the world has a Resume problem. Linkedin, Stack Overflow Jobs, and the list goes on. I want a simple and editable format like Markdown that is easy to edit. I am working on a script that uses PhantomJS and Casper to scrape my LinkedIn profile and get all the info. Till then, a flat markdown file would do just fine. Also, it was a lot of fun using flex-ordering!
