# Vik Ramanujam's Résumé

![alt text][logo]
Your friendly neighbourhood brogrammer.

Front-end & Nodejs developer
_Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia_

♥️ functional programming, i3, the command line & vim.

Technologist looking to build slick, large-scale & beautiful web applications. A programmer at heart and an engineer by mind. When I'm not coding (in React or [some bleeding-edge front-end micro-framework](https://hyperapp.js.org/)), I'm probably cooking, travelling or professing my undying love to Docker & Portainer.

I love building teams that deliver great, pixel-perfect, usable products. I care deeply about the people I work with. I bring a *never say die* attitude to any team, and ensure that everyone is pushing code of the highest quality. I love writing tests & teach as much as I can learn.

_**Technical Lead**_
BAE Systems Applied Intelligence

## Work Experience

### BAE Systems Applied Intelligence
_**Lead Front-end Developer**_
_June 2015 - Present (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia)_

Delivered a webapp built on Angular, ES6, SCSS, Angular Material that runs of 30 different browser / device combinations from Retina displays to mobile browsers, weeks ahead of schedule.
  *  led a team of ten developers to deliver, ahead of schedule a web application & mobile app which strict acceptance criterias for performance in low bandwidth areas.
  * ensured product quality by enforcing unit and integration tests.
  ▪️ conceived and implemented a filtering system that can be used in any project as a drop▪️in component (that can search and in▪️browser list of anything or pass it off to the backend).
  ▪️ engaged closely with ux daily to unsure delivery of a usable and slick▪️looking product. adviced against bad user experience and convulated user journeys.
  ▪️ evaluated requirements with business analysts to ensure stories are short, well▪️worded and most importantly, closable, with clear acceptance criteria.
  ▪️ ensured code was functional and lean with performance and usability as the pillars.
  ▪️ planned sprints and delegated tasks across the front▪️end team.
  ▪️ developed a reusable library / ux components within the first couple of sprints so that there was minimal to no front▪️end effort needed at the later stages of the project. focused on building highly configurable components rather than thousands of lines of redundant code.
  ▪️ involved heavily in code▪️reviews and (declining) pull▪️requests that would take the easy way out, have bad tests, or lack code comments.
  ▪️ promoted code reusability above all else, and ensured that we had a 90% higher test coverage when our deliverable limit was 80%.
  ▪️ streamlined and enhanced team's output by using an assembly▪️line mindset when managing task deligation. the payoff was huge as we continually impressed every sprint by delivering impressive work, consistenly. this however, will only work with a good, multi▪️disciplined team.
  ▪️ involved heavily with devops and build automation.
