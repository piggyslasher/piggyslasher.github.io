# Vik Ramanujam's Résumé

![alt text][logo]

Front-end & Nodejs developer
_Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia_

I've been a programmer at heart even before I've left school. I love getting my hands dirty with code. I use Linux & Mac, and prefer `working through the command line`. When I'm not coding or cooking, I'm probably travelling or professiong my undying love to Docker & Portainer.
