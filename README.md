# Vik Ramanujam's Résumé

![alt text][logo]
Your friendly neighbourhood brogrammer.

Front-end & Nodejs developer
_Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia_

♥️ functional programming, i3, the command line & vim.

Technologist looking to build slick, large-scale & beautiful web applications. A programmer at heart and an engineer by mind. When I'm not coding (in React or some obscure front-end micro-framework) or cooking, I'm probably travelling or professing my undying love to Docker & Portainer.

I love building teams that deliver great, pixel-perfect, usable products. I care deeply about the people I work with. I bring a *never say die* attitude to any team, and ensure that everyone is pushing code of the highest quality. I love writing tests & teach as much as I can learn.

## Currently

### BAE Systems Applied Intelligence
_**Technical Lead**_
BAE Systems Applied Intelligence
_Dec 2017 – Present_
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

Currently leading a team of Front-end developers tasked with building a next-generation product using React / Redux / RxJS / Styled Components that focuses on big-data, drill-downs, geolocation & clustering, Elastic Search, GraphQL, Docker amongst various other technologies.

## Work Experience

### BAE Systems Applied Intelligence
_**Lead Front-end Developer**_
_June 2015 - Present (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia)_

Delivered a webapp built on Angular, ES6, SCSS, Angular Material that runs of 30 different browser / device combinations from Retina displays to mobile browsers, weeks ahead of schedule.
→ Led a team of ten developers to deliver, ahead of schedule a web application & mobile app which strict acceptance criterias for performance in low bandwidth areas.
→ Ensured product quality by enforcing unit and integration tests.
→ Conceived and implemented a filtering system that can be used in any project as a drop-in component (that can search and in-browser list of anything or pass it off to the backend).
→ Engaged closely with UX daily to unsure delivery of a usable and slick-looking product. Adviced against bad user experience and convulated user journeys.
→ Evaluated requirements with Business Analysts to ensure stories are short, well-worded and most importantly, closable, with clear acceptance criteria.
→ Ensured code was functional and lean with performance and usability as the pillars.
→ Planned sprints and delegated tasks across the front-end team.
→ Developed a reusable library / UX components within the first couple of sprints so that there was minimal to no front-end effort needed at the later stages of the project. Focused on building highly configurable components rather than thousands of lines of redundant code.
→ Involved heavily in code-reviews and (declining) pull-requests that would take the easy way out, have bad tests, or lack code comments.
→ Promoted code reusability above all else, and ensured that we had a 90% higher test coverage when our deliverable limit was 80%.
→ Streamlined and enhanced team's output by using an assembly-line mindset when managing task deligation. The payoff was huge as we continually impressed every sprint by delivering impressive work, consistenly. This however, will only work with a good, multi-disciplined team.
→ Involved heavily with DevOps and build automation.
