# Vik Ramanujam's Résumé

![alt text][logo]

Front-end & Nodejs developer
_Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia_

Technologist looking to build slick, large-scale & beautiful web applications. A programmer at heart and an engineer by mind. When I'm not coding (in React or some obscure front-end micro framework) or cooking, I'm probably travelling or professing my undying love to Docker & Portainer.

I love building teams that deliver great, pixel-perfect, usable products. I care deeply about the people I work with. I bring a *never say die* attitude to any team, and ensure that everyone is pushing code of the highest quality. I love writing tests & teach as much as I can learn.
