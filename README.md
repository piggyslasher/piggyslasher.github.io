> Excuse me, but, there's a container for that :)

Technologist looking to build slick, large-scale & beautiful web applications. A programmer at heart and an engineer by mind. When I'm not coding (in React or [some bleeding-edge front-end micro-framework](https://hyperapp.js.org/)), I'm probably cooking, travelling or professing my undying love to Docker & Portainer.

I love building teams that deliver great, pixel-perfect, usable products. I care deeply about the people I work with. I bring a *never say die* attitude to any team, and ensure that everyone is pushing code of the highest quality. I love writing tests & teach as much as I can learn.

##### BAE Systems Applied Intelligence
**Lead Front-end Developer** | _June 2015 - December 2017_ | _Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia_

Engineered a webapp built on Angular, ES7, SCSS, Angular Material that runs of 30 different browser / device combinations from Retina displays to mobile browsers, weeks ahead of schedule.

  - Led a team of ten developers to deliver, ahead of schedule a web application & mobile app which strict acceptance criteria for performance in low bandwidth areas.
  - Ensured product quality by enforcing unit and integration tests.
  - Conceived and implemented a filtering system that can be used in any project as a drop-in component (that can search and in-browser list of anything or pass it off to the backend).
  - Engaged closely with UX daily to unsure delivery of a usable and slick-looking product. Adviced against bad user experience and convulated user journeys.
  - Evaluated requirements with Business Analysts to ensure stories are short, well-worded and most importantly, closable, with clear acceptance criteria.
  - Ensured code was functional and lean with performance and usability as the pillars.
  - Planned sprints and delegated tasks across the front-end team.
  - Developed a reusable library of UX components within the first couple of sprints so that there was minimal to no front-end effort needed at the later stages of the project. Focused on building highly configurable components rather than thousands of lines of redundant code.
  - Involved heavily in code-reviews and (declining) pull-requests that would take the easy way out, have bad tests, or lack code comments.
  - Promoted code reusability above all else, and ensured that we had a 90% higher test coverage when our deliverable limit was 80%.
  - Streamlined and enhanced team's output by using an assembly-line mindset when managing task deligation. The payoff was huge as we continually impressed every sprint by delivering impressive work, consistenly. This however, will only work with a good, multi-disciplined team.
  - Involved heavily with DevOps and build automation as I feel right at home on the command line.

  - Delivered dashboards consisting of heatmaps, filters, timelines and drill-down hunting using Highcharts / Highmaps / Angular / SASS that would interface with an elastic search backend.
  - Accelerated development of a pixel-perfect product with a strict delivery timeline, whilst keeping a focus on best practices.
  - Undertook interviewing and hiring of an extremely capable (and super-awesome) front-end development  team, which I eventually led - that could deliver complex and interesting projects.
  - Formulated a guide of best-practices in building good software for the front-end developers.

#### Recommendations
> Vik is a very passionate, relatable team lead, who is thriving to satisfy the customer needs by developing a sustainable solution.  
I had the pleasure working with Vik on a very complex Digital Transformation project, where he was leading the frontend team of our offshore team, which was fully accountable for the development of a responsive customer portal plus mobile apps.  
What gave me confidence from Day 1 in Vik and his team, was that Vik thought before he coded. Meaning, he established a full pattern library, which his team then could use, so that every element looked the same across the whole website and was easily extendable and maintainable.  
Vik took pride in his work and ownership for his deliverable, came up with suggestions on how to improve the designs and was closely working with the BAs, UX Team and Architects back in the UK.  
What was most important in a very busy complex project, that once Vik was involved, you could stop worrying and thinking about a task, as you knew it now would be completed to high standards.<br>The effort of Vik and his team meant, that we had hardly any Frontend related issues in the testing phase. The few defects raised were turned around quickly and the designs were implemented pixel perfect.  
  
Vik would always be one of my top3 choices for a senior FED Team lead, and after doing web projects for over two decades, there is a long list of people I would not chose.
>Vik is one who needs technical authority in decision-making (not kowtowing to another technical authority) and minimum bureaucratic rules (e.g. flexible working arrangements and casual dressing at work) in order to thrive. When one of these two ingredients are taken away from him, companies can expect him to repeatedly persevere in order to get the working environment and tools that he wants. However, when these two ingredients are provided to him, he flourishes and performs his best work, while maintaining the ability to listen to his team members and move together as a team. He is capable of identifying good talent, wielding the latest frontend technologies to do his bidding, and generally getting the job done all the same while automating away all the boring parts. Vik is the man to help you deliver, but allow him into your office only if you can give him the two aforementioned ingredients :)<br><br><strong>Jonathan Lin,</strong><br>Team Lead, BAE Systems Applied Intelligence
