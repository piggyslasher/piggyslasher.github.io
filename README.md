> Excuse me, but, there's a container for that :)

Technologist looking to build slick, large-scale & beautiful web applications. A programmer at heart and an engineer by mind. When I'm not coding (in React or [some bleeding-edge front-end micro-framework](https://hyperapp.js.org/)), I'm probably cooking, travelling or professing my undying love to Docker & Portainer.

I love building teams that deliver great, pixel-perfect, usable products. I care deeply about the people I work with. I bring a *never say die* attitude to any team, and ensure that everyone is pushing code of the highest quality. I love writing tests & teach as much as I can learn.

##### BAE Systems Applied Intelligence
**Lead Front-end Developer** | _June 2015 - December 2017_ | _Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia_

Engineered a webapp built on Angular, ES7, SCSS, Angular Material that runs of 30 different browser / device combinations from Retina displays to mobile browsers, weeks ahead of schedule.

  - Led a team of ten developers to deliver, ahead of schedule a web application & mobile app which strict acceptance criteria for performance in low bandwidth areas.
  - Ensured product quality by enforcing unit and integration tests.
  - Conceived and implemented a filtering system that can be used in any project as a drop-in component (that can search and in-browser list of anything or pass it off to the backend).
  - Engaged closely with UX daily to unsure delivery of a usable and slick-looking product. Adviced against bad user experience and convulated user journeys.
  - Evaluated requirements with Business Analysts to ensure stories are short, well-worded and most importantly, closable, with clear acceptance criteria.
  - Ensured code was functional and lean with performance and usability as the pillars.
  - Planned sprints and delegated tasks across the front-end team.
  - Developed a reusable library of UX components within the first couple of sprints so that there was minimal to no front-end effort needed at the later stages of the project. Focused on building highly configurable components rather than thousands of lines of redundant code.
  - Involved heavily in code-reviews and (declining) pull-requests that would take the easy way out, have bad tests, or lack code comments.
  - Promoted code reusability above all else, and ensured that we had a 90% higher test coverage when our deliverable limit was 80%.
  - Streamlined and enhanced team's output by using an assembly-line mindset when managing task deligation. The payoff was huge as we continually impressed every sprint by delivering impressive work, consistenly. This however, will only work with a good, multi-disciplined team.
  - Involved heavily with DevOps and build automation as I feel right at home on the command line.

  - Delivered dashboards consisting of heatmaps, filters, timelines and drill-down hunting using Highcharts / Highmaps / Angular / SASS that would interface with an elastic search backend.
  - Accelerated development of a pixel-perfect product with a strict delivery timeline, whilst keeping a focus on best practices.
  - Undertook interviewing and hiring of an extremely capable (and super-awesome) front-end development  team, which I eventually led - that could deliver complex and interesting projects.
  - Formulated a guide of best-practices in building good software for the front-end developers.

#### FAQ
  - **What technologies are being used to build this resume?**
    Absolutely no Javascript is used in the browser. The resume is based on one markdown file, and spell-checked and built using markdown by my trusty TravisCI. I use Neovim for coding, and (mostly) node for building.
  - **Why are you using CSS variables in SCSS? Are you mad?**
    Css variables can be inherited and scoped. This allows me to achieve things like changing the background and all other elements on the page with _zero_ javascript based on the `:checked` pseudo selector (still finding the perfect solution). I feel that I'm going to just use CSS variables for now rather than SCSS from now on - why? Because I'm debugging variable changes in the browser where it belongs .
  - **Are you available for work?**
    Yes.
  - **The README.md file seems to be in a different order. Is this intentional?**
    Yes, I used flex-ordering and sibling selectors (~) to re-order sections.
  - **That seems like overkill. Why couldn't you just wrap each section in a `<section class="interests">` tag and style them that way?**
    I think the world has a Resume problem. Linkedin, Stack Overflow Jobs, and the list goes on. I want a simple and editable format like Markdown that is easy to edit. I am working on a script that uses PhantomJS and Casper to scrape my LinkedIn profile and get all the info. Till then, a flat markdown file would do just fine. Also, it was a lot of fun using flex-ordering!
