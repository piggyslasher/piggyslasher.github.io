<hr>
<p>Front-end &amp; Nodejs developer
<em>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</em></p>
<p>♥️ functional programming, i3, the command line &amp; vim.</p>
<p>Technologist looking to build slick, large-scale &amp; beautiful web applications. A programmer at heart and an engineer by mind. When I&#39;m not coding (in React or <a href="https://hyperapp.js.org/">some bleeding-edge front-end micro-framework</a>), I&#39;m probably cooking, travelling or professing my undying love to Docker &amp; Portainer.</p>
<p>I love building teams that deliver great, pixel-perfect, usable products. I care deeply about the people I work with. I bring a <em>never say die</em> attitude to any team, and ensure that everyone is pushing code of the highest quality. I love writing tests &amp; teach as much as I can learn.</p>

<p><strong>Lead Front-end Developer</strong> | <em>June 2015 - Present</em> | <em>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</em>
Engineered a webapp built on Angular, ES7, SCSS, Angular Material that runs of 30 different browser / device combinations from Retina displays to mobile browsers, weeks ahead of schedule.
  - Led a team of ten developers to deliver, ahead of schedule a web application &amp; mobile app which strict acceptance criteria for performance in low bandwidth areas.
  - Ensured product quality by enforcing unit and integration tests.
  - Conceived and implemented a filtering system that can be used in any project as a drop-in component (that can search and in-browser list of anything or pass it off to the backend).
  - Engaged closely with UX daily to unsure delivery of a usable and slick-looking product. Adviced against bad user experience and convulated user journeys.
  - Evaluated requirements with Business Analysts to ensure stories are short, well-worded and most importantly, closable, with clear acceptance criteria.
  - Ensured code was functional and lean with performance and usability as the pillars.
  - Planned sprints and delegated tasks across the front-end team.
  - Developed a reusable library / UX components within the first couple of sprints so that there was minimal to no front-end effort needed at the later stages of the project. Focused on building highly configurable components rather than thousands of lines of redundant code.
  - Involved heavily in code-reviews and (declining) pull-requests that would take the easy way out, have bad tests, or lack code comments.
  - Promoted code reusability above all else, and ensured that we had a 90% higher test coverage when our deliverable limit was 80%.
  - Streamlined and enhanced team&#39;s output by using an assembly-line mindset when managing task deligation. The payoff was huge as we continually impressed every sprint by delivering impressive work, consistenly. This however, will only work with a good, multi-disciplined team.</p>
<ul>
<li>Involved heavily with DevOps and build automation as I feel right at home on the command line.</li>

  - Accelerated development of a pixel-perfect product with a strict delivery timeline, whilst keeping a focus on best practices.
  - Undertook interviewing and hiring of an extremely capable (and super-awesome) front-end development  team, which I eventually led - that could deliver complex and interesting projects.
  - Formulated a guide of best-practices in building good software for the front-end developers.</p>
