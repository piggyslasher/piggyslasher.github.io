<p>Technologist looking to build slick, large-scale &amp; beautiful web applications. A programmer at heart and an engineer by mind. When I&#39;m not coding (in React or <a href="https://hyperapp.js.org/">some bleeding-edge front-end micro-framework</a>), I&#39;m probably cooking, travelling or professing my undying love to Docker &amp; Portainer.</p>
<p>I love building teams that deliver great, pixel-perfect, usable products. I care deeply about the people I work with. I bring a <em>never say die</em> attitude to any team, and ensure that everyone is pushing code of the highest quality. I love writing tests &amp; teach as much as I can learn.</p>

<h5 id="bae-systems-applied-intelligence">BAE Systems Applied Intelligence</h5>
<p><em><strong>Technical Lead</strong></em><br><em>Dec 2017 – Present</em><br>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</p>
<p>Currently leading a team of Front-end developers tasked with building  a next-generation product using React / Redux / RxJS / Styled Components, Storyboook using ES7 that focuses on big-data, drill-downs, geolocation &amp; clustering, Elastic Search, GraphQL and obviously Docker (♥️) amongst various other technologies.</p>

<h5 id="bae-systems-applied-intelligence">BAE Systems Applied Intelligence</h5>
<p><strong>Lead Front-end Developer</strong> | <em>June 2015 - December 2017</em> | <em>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</em></p>
<p>Engineered a webapp built on Angular, ES7, SCSS, Angular Material that runs of 30 different browser / device combinations from Retina displays to mobile browsers, weeks ahead of schedule.</p>
<ul>
<li>Led a team of ten developers to deliver, ahead of schedule a web application &amp; mobile app which strict acceptance criteria for performance in low bandwidth areas.</li>
<li>Ensured product quality by enforcing unit and integration tests.</li>
<li>Conceived and implemented a filtering system that can be used in any project as a drop-in component (that can search and in-browser list of anything or pass it off to the backend).</li>
<li>Engaged closely with UX daily to unsure delivery of a usable and slick-looking product. Adviced against bad user experience and convulated user journeys.</li>
<li>Evaluated requirements with Business Analysts to ensure stories are short, well-worded and most importantly, closable, with clear acceptance criteria.</li>
<li>Ensured code was functional and lean with performance and usability as the pillars.</li>
<li>Planned sprints and delegated tasks across the front-end team.</li>
<li>Developed a reusable library of UX components within the first couple of sprints so that there was minimal to no front-end effort needed at the later stages of the project. Focused on building highly configurable components rather than thousands of lines of redundant code.</li>
<li>Involved heavily in code-reviews and (declining) pull-requests that would take the easy way out, have bad tests, or lack code comments.</li>
<li>Promoted code reusability above all else, and ensured that we had a 90% higher test coverage when our deliverable limit was 80%.</li>
<li>Streamlined and enhanced team&#39;s output by using an assembly-line mindset when managing task deligation. The payoff was huge as we continually impressed every sprint by delivering impressive work, consistenly. This however, will only work with a good, multi-disciplined team.</li>
<li>Involved heavily with DevOps and build automation as I feel right at home on the command line.</li>
</ul>

<li>Accelerated development of a pixel-perfect product with a strict delivery timeline, whilst keeping a focus on best practices.</li>
<li>Undertook interviewing and hiring of an extremely capable (and super-awesome) front-end development  team, which I eventually led - that could deliver complex and interesting projects.</li>
<li>Formulated a guide of best-practices in building good software for the front-end developers.</li>

<h4 id="faq">FAQ</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>What technologies are being used to build this resume?</strong><br>Absolutely no Javascript is used in the browser. The resume is based on one markdown file, and build using markdown by my trusty TravisCI. I use Neovim for coding, and (mostly) node for building.</li>
<li><strong>Why are you using CSS variables in SCSS? Are you mad?</strong><br>Css variables can be inherited and scoped. This allows me to achieve things like changing the background and all other elements on the page with <em>zero</em> javascript based on the <code>:checked</code> pseudo selector (still finding the perfect solution). I feel that I&#39;m going to just use CSS variables for now rather than SCSS from now on - why? Because I&#39;m debugging variable changes in the browser where it belongs .</li>
<li><strong>Are you available for work?</strong><br>Yes.</li>
<li><strong>The README.md file seems to be in a different order. Is this intentional?</strong><br>Yes, I used flex-ordering and sibling selectors (~) to re-order sections.</li>
<li><strong>That seems like overkill. Why couldn&#39;t you just wrap each section in a <code>&lt;section class=&quot;interests&quot;&gt;</code> tag and style them that way?</strong><br>I think the world has a Resume problem. Linkedin, Stack Overflow Jobs, and the list goes on. I want a simple and editable format like Markdown that is easy to edit. I am working on a script that uses PhantomJS and Casper to scrape my LinkedIn profile and get all the info. Till then, a flat markdown file would do just fine. Also, it was a lot of fun using flex-ordering!</li>
