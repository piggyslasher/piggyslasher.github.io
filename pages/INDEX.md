> Excuse me, but, there's a container for that :)

A battle-hardened technologist interested in building beautiful, large-scale and user-friendly web and mobile applications. ♥ functional programming, coding UI, the command line <span class="amp">&</span> Vim. When I'm not coding on React, I'm probably cooking, travelling or professing my undying love to micro-containers.

I love building teams that deliver great, pixel-perfect, usable products, getting my hands dirty with code when duty calls. I care deeply about the people I work with. I bring a *never say die* attitude to any team and ensure that everyone is pushing code of the highest quality. I love writing tests <span class="amp">&</span> teach as much as I can learn.

#### **Jun 2015 - Dec '17** Front-end Team Lead

##### **BAE Systems Applied Intelligence** | _Kuala Lumpur_

Engineered a web app built on Angular, ES7/8, SCSS, Angular Material that runs of 30 different browser/device combinations from Retina displays to mobile browsers, weeks ahead of schedule.

- Led a team of ten developers to deliver, ahead of schedule a web application & mobile app which strict acceptance criteria for performance in low bandwidth areas.
- Engaged with UX daily to ensure delivery of a usable and slick-looking product, advising against bad user experience and convoluted user journeys.
- Evaluated requirements with Business Analysts to ensure stories are short, well-worded with clear acceptance criteria and most importantly, closable.
- Spearheaded a culture of writing good code with performance and usability as pillars.
- Planned sprints and delegated tasks across the front-end team, and delivering features 4-5 sprints ahead of schedule.
- Developed a reusable library of UX components within the first couple of sprints so that there was minimal to no front-end effort at the later stages of the project. Guided the team to build highly configurable and reusable components.
- Involved heavily in code-reviews and (declining) pull-requests that would take the easy way out, have bad tests, or lack code comments and had a 90% test coverage when our deliverable limit was 80%.
- Streamlined team output by using an assembly-line mindset when managing task delegation. The payoff: we closed every sprint by delivering impressive work, consistently, keeping morale and confidence high.
- Involved heavily with DevOps and build automation as I feel right at home on the command line.
