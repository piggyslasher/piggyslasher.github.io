##### Requirements for Vik's Resume
This resume is a result of keeping an up to date curriculum vitae for a tech-savvy individual.

Resumes are everywhere. Linkedin, Stack Overflow, and I think Github will be implementing something real soon (they already have a job posting system). The latter two are websites that a developer _should_ be visiting every day. And, there's one more - the developer's own website that showcases his skills. It's a convulated mess keeping everything up to date. And having an up to date PDF file that can be emailed, should it be necessary.
