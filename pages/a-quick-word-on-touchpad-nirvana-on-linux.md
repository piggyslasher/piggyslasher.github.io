# A quick word on touchpad heaven on Linux
Short answer - there isn't one. Touchpad support has been amazing on MacOS. And on Windows, I'm not sure about the latest state of the public version of Windows, but I use the insiders build and multi-finger gestures are definitely improving. Nowhere near the awesomeness of the Mac but over the past couple of years, things have improved drastically.

But on Linux, it's a different story. It is, for the lack of a better word - shite.
