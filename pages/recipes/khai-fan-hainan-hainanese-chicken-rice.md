# Khai Fan Hainan (Hainanese Chicken rice)

This is one of my favorite dishes and it has 3 parts.
The bird
The soup
The sauce

## The bird
I used Adam Ragusea's hanging chicken hack to get a super crispy skin! I've cooked chicken and duck this way and probably cook them the regular way again :slightly_smiling_face:


Chicken Marinade - simple.
