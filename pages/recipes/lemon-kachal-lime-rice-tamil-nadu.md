# Lime or lemon kachal - to mix with rice

This is my mom's recipe. It's traditional lime masala to mix in with rice. You can use lemon or lime. I think both work well. Sometimes if I haven't been able to tell the difference when my mom cooks it.

## Prep

- [ ] Prepare dahl - if australian, soak in water for 10mins, white dahl doesn't need to soak. Dahl can give volume to the rice. I actually put quite a lot, like a handful, but you can use just a couple of table spoons.
- [ ] Prepare lime - Squeeze maybe 6 or 7 or one large lemon.
- [ ] pound some ginger
- [ ] add a little water, like 1/4 cup.
- [ ] add one teaspoon of Salt & Turmeric
- [ ] green chilli - split, 5-6 for each lemon, half that for lime

## Cook

- [ ] fry a teaspoon of mustard with dahl with a couple of table spoons of oil
- [ ] add bunch of curry leaves and the chilli
- [ ] Fry till dahl is brown
- [ ] Asefoetida - 1/2 spoon
- [ ] pour prepped lime juice
- [ ] bring to a boil amd do no leave to simmer to long (gets bitter). Switch off the flame. If you're needing to boil it too much, you've added too much water in the beginning.

_Note:_ Store it in a dry container. Like a pickle jar. Something airtight. Ensure it is dry, otherwise this would turn in a few weeks.

This is something that will last for a very long time in the fridge. They key is to add very little water and the boil and simmer process should just get rid of that little bit of water. What remains can be stored in the fridge to mix in with rice when you need it.
